# @tk/server-api

## Introduction

This project is a server API built with TypeScript and Express, supporting multiple environments for development, testing, and production.

## Multi-Environment Setup

To configure different environments, follow these steps:

1. Create an `.env` file in the `src/secrets/env/` folder for each environment (e.g., `.env.dev`, `.env.prod`, etc.).
2. Copy the contents of the `env.example` file into the new `.env` files and update the values as needed for each environment.

### Example `.env` Files

- `env.dev`

  PORT="your_system_port"
  NODE_ENV="development"
  DB_ADDRESS="your_mongodb_address"

## Environment Variables

The env.example file contains the following variables:

PORT: The port number the server will run on.
NODE_ENV: The environment mode (development, production, etc.).
DB_ADDRESS: The address of the MongoDB database.

## NPM Commands

The following npm commands are available for building, starting, and testing the application:

## Start in Production (Development Mode)

npm run start:prod
This command sets the environment to production and starts the server using ts-node-dev for hot-reloading.

## Build the Project

npm run build
This command compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript.

## Build and Start in Production

npm run build:start:prod

This command uses env-cmd to load the .env.prod file and then starts the server with the built code.

## Lint the Code

npm run lint
This command runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.

## Getting Started

npm install
npm run start:example

## Customizing Scripts for Different Environments

You can create custom scripts for different environments by modifying the scripts section of your package.json file. Hereâ€™s how you can set up scripts for various environments:

## Create a New Script

To create a new script for an environment, add an entry to the scripts section of package.json with a name indicating the environment. Use env-cmd to load the appropriate .env file, and nodemon or node to start the server.

"scripts": {
"build:start:example": "env-cmd -f ./src/secrets/env/.env.example node ./dist/server.js",
"start:example": "cross-env ENVIRONMENT=example nodemon --exec ts-node-dev -r tsconfig-paths/register src/server.ts",
"build:start:dev": "env-cmd -f ./src/secrets/env/.env.dev node ./dist/server.js",
"start:dev": "cross-env ENVIRONMENT=dev nodemon --exec ts-node-dev -r tsconfig-paths/register src/server.ts"
}

## Block src/secrets folder in .gitignore file

Remember to block the secrets folder in .gitignore file.
